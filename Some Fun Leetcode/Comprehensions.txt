comprehension is a concise way to create a new list(or set, dictionary)
from an existing iterable like a list, range, string, usually in one line.
instead of using a full for loop, you compress it into an expression.

regular way:
squares = []
for i in range(5):
    squares.append(i*i)
print(squares) 
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16]

list comprehension but same code:
squares = [i * i for i in range(5)]
print(squares)
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16]

basic syntax:
[expression for item, in iterable if condition]
